> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an early concept, not a working app yet. We're seeking partners to help prototype and test with worker communities! We are also looking for designers, developers, and nutritionists to join us.

Many migrant and shift workers in Singapore face challenges in maintaining a balanced diet due to:

- Limited budgets ($3–$6 per meal)
- Long shifts or irregular working hours
- Dependence on dormitory canteens, hawkers, or convenience stores
- Specific dietary requirements (Halal, vegetarian, etc.)
- Limited access to mobile data and cooking facilities

These challenges often lead to poor nutrition and stress.

Therefore, we propose **Nutrify**, a lightweight mobile app and campaign designed for migrant and shift workers in Singapore. The goal is to make it easier to eat healthy meals on a tight budget while respecting cultural and dietary needs.

✨ _Nutrify is a vision for better nutrition equity._
