Many migrant and shift workers in Singapore face challenges in maintaining a balanced diet due to:

- Limited budgets ($3–$6 per meal)
- Long shifts or irregular working hours
- Dependence on dormitory canteens, hawkers, or convenience stores
- Specific dietary requirements (Halal, vegetarian, etc.)
- Limited access to mobile data and cooking facilities

These challenges often lead to poor nutrition and stress.

Therefore, we propose **Nutrify**, a lightweight mobile app and campaign designed for migrant and shift workers in Singapore. The goal is to make it easier to eat healthy meals on a tight budget while respecting cultural and dietary needs.

✨ _Nutrify is a vision for better nutrition equity._ We envision a simple tool that can fit into workers' daily lives without extra cost or complexity:

- **Weekly Meal Planner**  
  Plans meals within a budget ($2–$4/meal) with easy swaps.

- **Canteen & Hawker Guide**  
  Quick suggestions for better choices (“less oil”, “extra veg”).

- **Recipe Cards**  
  5–10 minute recipes with 4–6 ingredients, designed for rice cookers, microwaves, or no kitchen at all.

- **Nutrition Meter**  
  Simple daily tracker for carbs, protein, vegetables, and water.

- **Multilingual Support**  
  English, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Tamil, Hindi, and Bengali.

- **Privacy First**  
  No accounts, no tracking, no employer access.

Nutrify is designed for:

- **Dormitory workers** — construction, manufacturing, shipyard staff
- **Domestic workers** — live-in caregivers with limited kitchen control
- **Shift/night workers** — security guards, cleaners, drivers

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an early concept, not a working app yet. We're seeking partners to help prototype and test with worker communities! We are also looking for designers, developers, and nutritionists to join us.
