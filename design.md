# Design Principles

We designed Nutrify to be:

- **Simple** — easy to use, quick to navigate
- **Affordable** — low data usage, minimal storage
- **Culturally Sensitive** — respects dietary needs and preferences
- **Practical** — realistic meal ideas for tight budgets and limited facilities
- **Inclusive** — supports multiple languages and literacy levels

We envision a simple tool that can fit into workers' daily lives without extra cost or complexity:

- **Weekly Meal Planner**  
  Plans meals within a budget ($2–$4/meal) with easy swaps.

- **Canteen & Hawker Guide**  
  Quick suggestions for better choices (“less oil”, “extra veg”).

- **Recipe Cards**  
  5–10 minute recipes with 4–6 ingredients, designed for rice cookers, microwaves, or no kitchen at all.

- **Nutrition Meter**  
  Simple daily tracker for carbs, protein, vegetables, and water.

- **Multilingual Support**  
  English, Bahasa Indonesia, Tagalog, Tamil, Hindi, and Bengali.

- **Privacy First**  
  No accounts, no tracking, no employer access.

Nutrify is designed for:

- **Dormitory workers** — construction, manufacturing, shipyard staff
- **Domestic workers** — live-in caregivers with limited kitchen control
- **Shift/night workers** — security guards, cleaners, drivers
